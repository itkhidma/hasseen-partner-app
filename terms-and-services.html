    <h2>4. Fees and Payments</h2>
    <p>The App may facilitate payments between users and Service Providers. Any applicable commission, service fees, or payout terms will be communicated separately and may be updated from time to time. You agree to abide by these terms and any payment schedules communicated through the App or official channels.</p>

    <h2>5. User Information</h2>
    <p>When accepting a booking, you will receive user details such as name, phone number, address, and appointment time. You agree to use this information solely for the purpose of fulfilling the requested service. Any misuse of user data may result in account suspension or termination.</p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>All content, branding, and features of the App are the exclusive property of Hasseen and its affiliates. You are granted a limited, non-transferable, non-exclusive license to use the App solely for the purposes described in these Terms. You may not reproduce, distribute, or create derivative works without prior written permission.</p>

    <h2>10. Modifications</h2>
    <p>We may modify these Terms at any time. If material changes are made, we will provide notice through the App or by email. Continued use of the App after changes are effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>
