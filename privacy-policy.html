    <section>
      <p>Welcome to <strong>Hasseen Partner</strong> (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information when professional salon service providers ("Service Providers") use the App to receive and fulfill service requests from users of the Hasseen User App. By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>
    </section>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>We collect the information necessary for Service Providers to receive, confirm, and fulfill salon service appointments. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>User-provided details:</strong> Full name, delivery/service address, phone number, appointment date and time, requested services, and any notes the user includes with the booking.</li>
      <li><strong>Order and transaction information:</strong> Service type, booking ID, status updates (accepted, in progress, completed), and timestamps related to appointments.</li>
<li><strong>Location information:</strong> If you enable location features, the App may access your device's location to match nearby Service Providers and to present distance and routing information. Exact location is only used where necessary and with your consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use the collected information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To route booking requests from Hasseen User App users to nearby Service Providers and deliver the details required to perform the requested service.</li>
      <li>To display appointment information and status to Service Providers so they can accept, manage, and complete bookings.</li>
      <li>To communicate important updates and notifications related to bookings.</li>
    
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
    <p>We will not sell personal information. We may share information in the following situations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> When a user makes a booking, the user’s name, address, phone number, appointment time, and relevant order details are shared with the Service Provider who accepts the request so they can perform the service.</li>
     
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>We retain personal information for as long as necessary to provide the App’s services, to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce agreements. Retention periods may vary depending on the type of information and applicable law.</p>

    <h2>5. Security</h2>
    <p>We implement reasonable technical, administrative, and physical safeguards designed to protect personal information. While we strive to protect data, no security measure is perfect or impenetrable. You should take care when transmitting information to us and avoid sending sensitive information through insecure channels.</p>

    <h2>6. Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>Subject to local law, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, request deletion of, or limit the processing of your personal data. To exercise these rights or to request a copy of the data we hold about you, please contact us at the address below. We will respond to verifiable requests consistent with applicable laws.</p>

    <h2>7. Children</h2>
    <p>The App is intended for adult Service Providers and is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under applicable minimum ages. If you believe we have collected information about a child in violation of local law, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>

   

    
    <h2>8. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make material changes, we will provide notice through the App or by other means prior to the change taking effect. The "Effective date" at the top of this policy indicates when the most recent update took effect.</p>
